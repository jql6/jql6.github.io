  <h3>Intro</h3>
  <p>
    LaTeX is great for writing math electronically. LaTeX is generally
    pronounced as "lay-teck" or "lah-teck"; I prefer "lay-teck". LaTeX is able
    to easily do lots of math things easily such as subscripts within
    subscripts, matrices, and switch between math notation and English text
    fairly easily.

    is likely where I downloaded my texshop. Texshop is what you'll use to
    write LaTeX in.

  <h3>Stationery</h3>
  <p>
    Stationery are templates for LaTeX. As a beginner, it's best to start out
    with a good stationery so you can get to using LaTeX right away without
    fiddling with setup issues. For me, these files are located in:

  <code>~/Library/TeXShop/New/Version-4.31/Stationery</code>
  <p>I have been using LaTeX for a while now; here is my
